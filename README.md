# FFXIV Hunts Path Finder

www.ffxivhuntspath.com was a simple website, until 2th of October of 2020, made to help with the daily hunts in the videogame Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. The website was born as an internal tool for our Free Company, therefore was made quickly, and with the data gathered manually by some members of the Free Company. After some time, it gained some popularity, and some features were added and improved thanks to the ideas and feedback of the community.

Why do I tell you all of this?

Let's face it, if you see the code, you'll realize instantly that it's a huge mess, initially was made in PHP in a day using Notepad++. It faced some changes, but the core remained. I always wanted to release this code and make it public so it could be improved much more, but due to it's awful nature, never dared to do so. Now that the original website is down, thought this could do some good, and other people maybe could resume this work, or remake it.

# How to make it run?

The code only requires PHP 7+ and a MariaDB/MySQL database. You only need to execute the file database.sql in your database, and modify the parameters of the config.php to match your database parameters, and your site.

# Something else to add?

I'd like to thank all the people that has supported this website, in any way, throught these years, and made it possible to keep this tool for so long. Thank you all.

Guybrush.
